The first day of Christmas,
My true love sent to you
A partridge in a pear tree.

The second day of Christmas,
My true love sent to you
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree.

The third day of Christmas,
My true love sent to me
Three French hens,
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree.
